    <h2>Vinyard Farming</h2>
    <p>Atlas Vineyard Management is well known for quality farming practices to produce first class vineyards, as evidenced by the Wine Spectator's top 100 wines of 2011. The number one rated wine in 2011 was Kosta Browne's Sonoma Coast 2009 Pinot Noir which came from two of our vineyards, Walala and Gaps Crown. Our secret is that we continue to farm the properties that we have developed. We are proud of our extensive vineyard portfolio that boasts grapes of equal caliber.</p>

    <p>We are unique in that we farm in multiple regions including Santa Rita Hills and Santa Barbara County on the Central Coast; Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties; continuing up into the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The knowledge that we gain through farming in such diverse locations is invaluable to us and our clients.</p>

    <p>With over 1600 acres of vineyards to manage, our client list is diverse, as are our vineyard sites. Utilizing advanced farming and viticulture techniques, and state-of-the-art analytical software allows us to farm in key appellations up and down the west coast. Each area can be addressed with the best farming practices for that site. Technology usage in the field in the form of iPads provides us, and our clients with essential and timely communication.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to produce the highest quality grapes from each vineyard site using the best sustainable practices.
